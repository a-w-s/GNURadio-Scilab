Portable Serial Toolbox for Scilab by Enrico Segre
==================================================

Drop the whole directory SCI/contrib to have this toolbox available at pulldown in 
scilab. Otherwise, just exec loader.sce.

Tested successfully so far on linux FC5, winXp, win98.

I'm looking forward for comments, expecially about uncommon platforms supported 
(Mac is known to be not), performance w.r.o. linking to native serial port drivers
(e.g. serial.dll at http://www.gds-sw.de/goodies.htm).

The implementation via TCL wrappers is certainly suboptimal, but shouldn't be such
a penalty, given the low bandwidth and the intrinsic asynchronous mode of serial 
communication. And mainly, it relieves the developer from supporting many platforms 
at once. In absence of any other common toolbox for serial port control in scilab,
I'd like to propose it for inclusion in Scilab 5. Please lobby for it against 
scilab@inria.fr

==========

v.0.2: corrected version after report of bug 3829  
(readserial/writeserial confused by strings containing nonprintable ascii characters,
see http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3829 )

Toolbox essentially still geared for scilab 4.x (4.1.2, scicoslab) in the sense that:

-builder.sce and loader.sce make use of xmltohtml(), add_help_chapter(); xml files are 
 based on the 4.x dtd (IF I would be able to make doc in scilab5 I might even consider to
 package a new help page set together with the old)
 
-in many points the detour TCL_EvalStr("set answ [....]"); TCL_GetVar("answ")
 is still implemented (was mandatory prior to request 319, see 
 http://requestzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=319), it is not required since
 scilab 4.1.2
 
 However, the toolbox is reported to work with Scilab 5.0.2 final [I suppose, without help
 pages readable in the help widget, but that's minor; html files provided, anyway]
